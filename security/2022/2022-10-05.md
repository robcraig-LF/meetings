* Discuss implementing VEX in SPDX 3.0 Security Profile

## Notes

 * Discuss implementing VEX in SPDX 3.0 Security Profile, see FIX INSERT GIST LINK
 * Thomas: showed an example how VEX could be implemented using amend to indicated previous VEX status relationship is not longer valid.
 * CycloneDX has additional fields in their VEX support see bom-examples/vex.json at master · CycloneDX/bom-examples (github.com). Do we want to incorporate these fields which are not in the VEX spec
 * Bob: Which VEX specification do we follow CISA, CSAF or CycloneDX implemention?
 * Thomas: I like the "justification" and "response" but would tweak "response" as in the current version of the spec it not possible say in your "reponse" that one should update to a particular version that is secure and works with application 
* Bob: Set up a working meeting with Sean, William - walk them thru what we have been thinking, get their feedback/suggestions based on their insights of core.
* Thomas: Email William but unavble to get a response
* Bob: Send him reminder 'ping' email 
* Thomas: Would love to work out some example of security scenarios as input but missing clarity how to do things with core - Missing spec
* Karsten: Currently you are trying to capture using relationships, but lack info. Create a dedicated element
* Bob: A new kind of artifact, new artifact for Defects
