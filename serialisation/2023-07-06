- Serialization formats

## Notes

- Duplicate property names (in different profiles)
  - JSON-LD context shorthands
  - current example: "locator" both in core and security
  - DECISION: if not unique, name has to be qualified (e.g. "core:locator" and "security:locator")

- JSON-LD context shorthands
  - Discussion on whether shorthands of "profile:property" to "property" should even be there
  - mention that context will be versioned
    - e.g. http://spdx.org/rdf/v3/context.json  vs   http://spdx.org/rdf/v3.1/context.json

- Serialization formats
  - we have said that we want to support multiple serialization formats
  - RDF definitely
  - JSON can be done in multiple ways
    - JSON-LD-as-JSON
    - simple JSON
  - other formats, possibly including a very simple printf-generated
